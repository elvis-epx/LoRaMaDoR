Change README, add section about remote control/non-amateur uses

L4 HMAC protocol
	- generate
	- check
	- store my key, store peers' keys, PSK generic key
	- https://github.com/simonratner/Arduino-SHA-256

Add example of application (try some sensor and LED control)
	- enable/disable protocols in build

No-replay mixin protocol
	- report error to higher level?

Confirmed mixin protocol
	- use C or create a separete impl?
	- report error to higher level?
	- retransmission
	- exponential backoff

Log/debug x interfacing with PC over serial
	- allow to autom. distinguish packets from debug messages
	- allow for a PC to implement one side of the L7 protocol
	- autonomous x PC stack
	- test collaborated Python code against changes

Telnet, serial x security
	- cases: Telnet login/sniffing, stolen device
	- do not show keys once stored?
	- Telnet password?

Cryptography support

Possibility of remote, NAT-piercing access
Add !version command
Gateway via Internet, IP router
