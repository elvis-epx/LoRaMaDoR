Change README, add section about remote control/non-amateur uses

L4 HMAC protocol
	- test in target
	- unit test: simulate failure
	- unit test: simulate L7 break x hide_from_user

Add example of application (try some sensor and LED control)
	- enable/disable protocols in build

No-replay mixin protocol
	- report error to higher level?

Confirmed mixin protocol
	- use C or create a separete impl?
	- report error to higher level?
	- retransmission
	- exponential backoff

Log/debug x interfacing with PC over serial
	- allow to autom. distinguish packets from debug messages
	- allow for a PC to implement one side of the L7 protocol
	- autonomous x PC stack
	- test collaborated Python code against changes

Telnet, serial x security
	- cases: Telnet login/sniffing, stolen device
	- do not show keys once stored?
	- Telnet password?

Cryptography support

HMAC - multiple keys

Possibility of remote, NAT-piercing access
Add !version command
Gateway via Internet, IP router
