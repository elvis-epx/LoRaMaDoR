Resetting after changing crypto key and receiving a packet
	(only on ESP32 target)
Seems not to reset if does not get a packet immediately after
	changing the password

Roadmap in MD format
	- multiple devices for 1 callsign (tx in one, rx in another)

Telnet, serial x security
	- cases: Telnet login/sniffing, stolen device
	- Telnet password?

HMAC - multiple keys

Possibility of remote, NAT-piercing access
Gateway via Internet, IP router
