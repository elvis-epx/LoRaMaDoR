	(only on ESP32 target)

	changing the password

Change README, add section about remote control/non-amateur uses

Telnet, serial x security
	- cases: Telnet login/sniffing, stolen device
	- do not show PSK, keys once stored?
	- Telnet password?

HMAC - multiple keys

Possibility of remote, NAT-piercing access
Gateway via Internet, IP router
