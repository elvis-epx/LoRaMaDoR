# Non-amateur usage

Even though this project sees amateur radio community as the primary
user, we feel LoRaMaDoR provides a good foundation for non-amateur
uses of LoRa radios. Encryption was specifically implemented for
these use cases.

(Amateurs must communicate using cleartext; on the
other hand, amateurs are not bound to ISM band limitations of
transmitter power, antenna gain and duty cycle.)

The Proto\_Switch protocol is the initial PoC of something that
I intend to use in a real-world scenario: control lights and
actuators remotely over a reasonably high distance (~1km). 
Other home automation technologies I have checked (X10, Bluetooth,
Wi-Fi) have 1/10 of the needed range.

The Switch protocol has to implement protection against relay
attacks. It uses a challenge-response scheme, and packets must
be either encrypted or HMAC-signed to make sure the response can
be trusted.
