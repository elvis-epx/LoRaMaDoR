# LoRaMaDoR - ham radio based on LoRa 

This project is inspired by LoRaHam. The major enhancement is a packet format
which is more powerful and more extensible, allowing for true network formation.
The implementation is a work in
progress, and more documentation will be added as time permits.

# Terminal (CLI) usage

Set the speed to 115200bps, connect to Arduino's serial port
using the terminal software of your choice (screen, minicom, etc.),
and start chatting!

Users can use the protocol almost directly, with a "hands on" sensation,
the implementation fills in the red tape to generate a valid packet.
For example, a user types:

```
QC Chat tonight 22:00 at repeater 147.000
```

"QC" is the pseudo-destination for broadcast messages. The
actual transmitted packet (minus the FEC suffix) is something like:

```
QC<PU5EPX-11:33 Chat tonight 22:00 at repeater 147.000
```

There are some commands, all start with ! (exclamation point):

```
!callsign ABCDEF-1
!debug
!help
```

To show the currently configured callsign, call !callsign without a parameter.
By default is FIXMEE-1. Type !help to get a list of all available commands.

# More examples

Example of beacon packet, sent automatically every 10 minutes by
every station:

```
QB<PU5EPX-11:2 bat=7.93V temp=25.4C wind=25.4kmh
```

How to ping another station:

```
PP5CRE-11:PING test123
```

Actual traffic:
```
PP5CRE-11<PU5EPX-11:21,PING test123
PU5EPX-11<PP5CRE-11:54,PONG test123
```

Route request:

```
PP5CRE-11:RREQ test123
```

Actual traffic:
```
PP5CRE-11<PU5EPX-11:RREQ
```

Possible response:
```
PU5EPX-11<PP5CRE-11:RRSP >PP5ABC>PU5XYZ|PP5CRE-11>PU5ABC
```

## Packet format

A LoRaMaDoR packet is composed by three parts: header, payload and FEC code.
The header contains source callsign, destination callsign, and some 
parameters:

```
Destination<Source:Parameters Payload FEC
```

There shall not be spaces within the header. If there is a payload, it is separated
from the header by a single space. The FEC code is mandatory, and it is specified
in its own section later on.

Stations shall have 4 to 7 octets, shall not start with "Q", and may be suffixed
by an SSID. Special or pseudo-callsigns are: QB (beacon) for automatic broadcast
sent every 10 minutes, QC (think "CQ") for human broadcasting, and QL ("loopback")
for debugging/testing.

Parameters are a set of comma-separated list of items, for example:

```
123,A,B=C,D,E=FGH
```

The parameters can be in three formats: naked number, naked key, and key=value.

There shall be one and only one naked number in the parameter list: it is the
packet ID. Together with the source callsign, it uniquely identifies the packet
within the network in a 20-minute time window. This is used to e.g. avoid 
forwarding the same packet twice.

Keys (naked or not) must be composed of capital letters and numbers only, and must start
with a letter. Values may be composed of any characters except those used as delimiters
in the header (space, comma, equal, etc.)

A value can be empty and this should be handled different from a naked key e.g.
in `A=,B`, B is naked while A has a value, which is an empty string. Implementations
should allow for this distinction.

Predefined parameters:

`R` signals the packet was forwarded. Stamped in packets with destination `QB` and `QC`.

`RREQ` (route request) asks for an automated `RRSP` response. Intermediate routers are
annotated in the message payload.

`PING` asks for an automated `PONG` response.

`T=number` is an optional timestamp, as the UNIX timestamp (seconds since 1/1/1970
0:00 UTC) subtracted by 1552265462. If sub-second precision is required, the number
can have decimal places.

`S=chars` is an optional digital signature of the payload.

## Routing and forwarding

Currently, diffusion routing is the only implemented strategy.

## FEC code

Every packet is augmented by a 20-octet FEC (Forward Error Code) suffix.
The FEC is a Reed-Solomon code.

Since Reed-Solomon codes demand a fixed-size message, it is calculated as if
the network packet was padded with nulls (binary zeros).

In order to contemplate low-memory microcontrollers, which cannot handle RS codes
above a certain size, two base sizes (and therefore two different RS codes) are
used: 100/80 and 200/180.

The reference FEC RS implementation is https://github.com/simonyipeter/Arduino-FEC .

## LoRa mode

Packets shall be transmitted using LoRa explicit mode, so the packet size is known
when it reaches the network layer to be parsed. CRC shall be disabled.

In our experiments, LoRa packets often arrive with errors even under the
best circunstances. Using maximum CR is not enough to prevent this, and
LoRa CRC protection would discard lots of packets. Software-level FEC code
seems to be the best solution.

## Telnet CLI

The terminal can be accessed using a Telnet client. You just have to configure
the WiFi, using the commands !ssid, !password, then !reset and check the
connection messages to see if it is all Ok. Type !wifi to get the network
status.

You can open the Telnet session using the IP (shown in !wifi). Bonjour (mDNS)
is supported, so you can try using the name e.g. FIXMEE-1.local or fixmee-1.local
instead of the IP.

Then a Telnet client is connected, the serial terminal is disabled, though it
still shows some messages related to Wi-Fi disconnection and reconnection. All
other messages, including debug messages, are redirected to the Telnet client
while the connection is open.
